The trade market for used games

## Brainstorm
The market has two core concepts: Supply and Demand
These create two trending chart: Purchase price and Sell price
A transaction happens when the purchase price and the sell price touch
The stock market also has two lines, but because there are so many users, the two lines are so close together that it appears as one.

## Layout
On Game Market, when a seller supplies a game, they also put how much they want to sell it for (including shipping). If they want an instant transaction, they can sell it for the current highest Purchase price.
When a buyer wants to demand a game, they also put how much they want to buy it for. If they want an instant transaction, they can buy it for the current lowest Sell price.
All sales are assumed to be standard shipping and disc/cartridge only. The buyer has no obligation to provide the booklet or case.

## Marketing
The service is completely free and should be marketed as such. For the first time, there is no redtape in the trading of used games. We pair a willing buyer with a willing seller. No tokens, credits, fees, or bs. All transactions are made through PayPal or some other form of instant cash.

## Monitizing
If the service is seen to be popular, then monitizing can be done through creating new user services or advertising.
