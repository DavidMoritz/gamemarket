The trade market for games

## Brainstorm
The market has two core concepts: Supply and Demand
These create two trending chart: Purchase price and Sell price
A transaction happens when the purchase price and the sell price touch
The stock market also has two lines, but because there are so many users, the two lines are so close together that it appears as one.

## Layout
On Game Market, when a seller supply a game, they also put how much they want to sell it for. If they want an instant transaction, they can sell it for the current highest Purchase price.
When a buyer wants to demand a game, they also put how much they want to buy it for. If they want an instant transaction, they can buy it for the current lowest Sell price.
